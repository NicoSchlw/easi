Domain and codomain
  The set of all permitted inputs to a given function is called the domain
  of the function, while the set of permissible outputs is called the
  codomain.

Map
  A map transforms a m-dimensional input vector into an n-dimensional
  output vector.

Filter
  A filter is a boolean function which either accepts or rejects input vectors.

Composite components
  A composite component is a component with attached components
  (that is, a composite is the root of a tree).
  Basically, it means that several components can be plugged to process
  a chain of operations.
  Maps and Filters are composite components, Builders are not.
